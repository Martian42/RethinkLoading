            <p>
                An understanding of loading is fundamental to the efficiency and safety of any structure, Although limited by values stated in design standards, geometry and definition of load type are variables that is only as accurate as the coordination between the client and the design team. An instant would be room loading, at early design stage overly conservatve loading are assumed due to uncertianty. Both the clients and the design team would benefit from having previous projects data when defining loads.

            <p>The aim of the project is to evaluate loads in use. The proposed method is to first track down the type of building use to be evaluated, then define the loads within those projets that are not clearly definded by design standards. With that clearly defined, we can focus on reseaching into all the BH projects in the relevant type of building use. Within all the projects, we can perform an empirical study, evaluating the actual loading in use.

            <P>By showing our motivation to self-evaluate the accuracy of our design in pursuit of outcome driven design, our clients can be certian that we have better insight than our competitors, with their interest in mind.</P>
